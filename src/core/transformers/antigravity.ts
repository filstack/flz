## Project Conventions

- Follow existing code style and patterns in the project
- Use conventional commits format for all commit messages
- Always check for existing implementations before creating new ones
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Run tests after making changes when test infrastructure exists

## Skill Usage

- Use \`/aif-plan\` for new features — creates branch, plan, and tasks
- Use \`/aif-fix\` for bug fixes — analyzes, fixes, suggests tests
- Use \`/aif-commit\` for commits — follows conventional commits
- Use \`/aif-implement\` to execute plans step by step
- Use \`/aif-review\` before merging — checks code quality

## Safety

- Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials
- Never force-push to main/master branches
- Always create feature branches for new work

    const conventionsContent = `# AI Factory Conventions

## Workflow Structure

AI Factory organizes skills into three categories:

### Workflows (.agent/workflows/)
Action-oriented skills that execute specific tasks:
- \`aif-plan.md\` — Plan and develop new features
- \`aif-fix.md\` — Fix bugs with structured approach
- \`aif-implement.md\` — Execute plans step by step
- \`aif-commit.md\` — Create conventional commits
- \`aif-review.md\` — Code review checklist
- \`aif-deploy.md\` — Deployment automation
- \`aif-ci.md\` — CI/CD pipeline setup

### Skills (.agent/skills/)
Knowledge-based skills providing guidelines and patterns:
- \`best-practices/\` — Code quality standards
- \`architecture/\` — Architecture decision records
- Stack-specific skills generated by \`/aif\`

### Rules (.agent/rules/)
Always-active guardrails and conventions that apply to every interaction.

## Naming Convention

- Workflow files: \`aif-{action}.md\` (flat files)
- Skill directories: \`{skill-name}/SKILL.md\` (with supporting files)
- Rule files: \`aif-{rule-name}.md\`
